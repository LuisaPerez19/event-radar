# My Event Radar

Welcome to My Event Radar, your go-to web application for discovering local events in London that match your interests. This README will guide you through the project and help you get started.

## Project Idea

My Event Radar is a web application designed to simplify the process of discovering local events in London that align with user interests. We've implemented a variety of features aimed at streamlining the event discovery process. Our primary goal is to ensure that users don't feel overwhelmed when searching for events.

## How to Access It

Visit our web application at [myeventradar.co.uk](http://www.myeventradar.co.uk).

As a marketplace web application, we've created our own event seeds for you to explore. To view these events, you can enter keywords such as Music, Food, or Education in the search bar on October 1, 2023, or create your own event and search for it using the search bar.

Afterward, you can click on "View Event Details," and you'll be prompted to log in. You can either sign up and create your own account or use the following credentials:

- Username: luisa.perez@myevent.com
- Password: 123456

Once logged in, you can book events, add as many tickets as you'd like, and engage with other attendees through the event chat.

## Technology Used

Our web application utilizes the following technologies:

- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails, following the MVC model.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Stimulus JavaScript (JS).
- **Map Integration**: MapBox API for displaying event locations on a map.
- **Search Functionality**: PG Search for a search bar, enabling users to search by categories or specific keywords.
- **User Authentication**: Devise Gem.
- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL.
- **Event Booking**: Simple Form.
- **Real-time Chat**: Action Cable and Stimulus JS, allowing users to connect before attending events.
- **Image Storage**: Cloudinary.
- **Web Hosting**: Heroku.

## Next Steps

We're actively working on making our app responsive for all screen sizes. Additionally, we're exploring up-to-date event APIs to provide users access to all local events, expanding beyond our initially seeded events.

Thank you for using My Event Radar, and we hope you have a fantastic experience discovering and attending local events with our platform!
